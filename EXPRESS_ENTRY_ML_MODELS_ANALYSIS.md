## üî¨ **Detailed Model Analysis**

### **1. ü•á SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**

**Description:**
SARIMA extends ARIMA by explicitly modeling seasonal patterns, making it ideal for Express Entry draws which exhibit clear seasonal trends (fewer draws during holidays, consistent bi-weekly patterns).

**How it Works:**
- **Seasonal Component:** Captures recurring patterns (e.g., holiday effects, quarterly policy cycles)
- **Autoregressive:** Uses past values to predict future values
- **Integration:** Handles non-stationary data through differencing
- **Moving Average:** Incorporates past forecast errors

**Express Entry Application:**
```python
# Example SARIMA configuration for EE draws
SARIMA(order=(1,1,1), seasonal_order=(1,1,1,26))  # 26 for bi-weekly seasonality
```

**Strengths for EE Prediction:**
- Excellent at capturing bi-weekly draw patterns
- Handles holiday seasonality automatically
- Accounts for policy change impacts through trend breaks
- Proven performance in government administrative data

    LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(sequence_length, n_features)),
    LSTM(50, return_sequences=False),
    Dense(25),
    Dense(1)  # CRS score prediction
])
```

**Strengths for EE Prediction:**

    'days_since_last_draw', 'unemployment_rate', 'pool_size',
    'pnp_invitations', 'is_holiday', 'month', 'quarter',
    'economic_indicators', 'policy_announcement'
]
```

**Strengths for EE Prediction:**
