I want to create a web app to predict the next Canadian Express Entry draw. The project name is ExpressEntryPredictor. I want to predict the date and CRS cut-off score for the next draw for each category. Here are what I want:

- Create a Django-based project with the simplest and fastest technologies.
- I want to use PostgreSQL as the database for production but SQLite for development on local machine.
- I have put all the data for previous draw rounds in the folder: data/draw_data.csv.
- I want to use sophisticated statistical models to predict the next draw date and CRS cut-off score for each category.
- To do so, I have collected the list of variables in EEP_data_source.md. Check if they make sense to be used in the prediction model. Also, give me instruction on how to collect them.
- I want to use up to 5 models to predict the next draw date and CRS cut-off score for each category. Of these suggest and implement the best ones including traditional and machine learning models.
